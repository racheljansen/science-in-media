# Science in the Media
### Experiment code for R. Jansen, A. Paxton, P. Krafft, & T. L. Griffiths (in preparation)

This is a transmission-chain style experiment to explore how people understand science as it is presented in the media. The first participant in each chain is sent to one of five random articles (specified in the `static/stimuli` folder), reads the article, and then writes a summary of the finding. The second participant in the chain receives the first participant's summary and then writes their own summary of that finding. This process continues iteratively down the chain.

All participants are also asked to complete a brief survey after completing their summary. The survey includes questions about their demographics, their impressions of the study, and their prior experience with the scientific process.
