              <p>This HIT is a psychology experiment being conducted by Rachel Jansen
                    (a graduate student and lead researcher), Alexandra Paxton (a postdoctoral
                    scholar), and Peter Krafft (a postdoctoral scholar) in Professor Tom
                    Griffiths's Computational Cognitive Science Lab at the University of
                    California, Berkeley. In order to consent to participate, you MUST
                    meet the following criteria:</p>
                      <ul>
                        <li>Be 18 years of age or older.</li>
                        <li>Be a fluent speaker of English.</li>
                        <li>Have not participated in this experiment before.</li>
                      </ul>

                  <p>The study will take about 15 minutes and will pay $1.75.</p>

                  <p>Your participation in this research is voluntary. You may refrain from answering any questions that make you uncomfortable and may withdraw your participation at any time without penalty by returning the HIT on MTurk and emailing the experimenter at the address provided below.</p>

                  <p>Participating will provide no direct benefits to you. But, we hope that this research will benefit society at large. Many problems that people can solve very easily are very difficult to automate (to have computers solve). By revealing more about how humans learn and think, our research may help others to build and program computers that can solve these kinds of problems.</p>

                  <p>The risks of our study procedures do not significantly exceed the risks associated with sitting at a computer or desk and answering a series of questions. As with all online experiments, there is a risk of a breach in confidentiality, however, we will take measures to reduce the probability of a breach, and even in the case of a breach, the data collected within this study are unlikely to have a negative impact on your life should they be associated with you.</p>

                  <p>Your MTurk worker ID may be connected to individual responses, and you may be asked to provide an email address, but this will be optional (you can complete the whole study without providing an email should you choose). We will handle responses as confidentially as possible. We cannot however guarantee the confidentiality of information transmitted over the Internet. We will be keeping data collected as part of this experiment indefinitely. Data without any personally identifiable data associated with it will be made available on public research data sharing sites for further analysis.</p>
