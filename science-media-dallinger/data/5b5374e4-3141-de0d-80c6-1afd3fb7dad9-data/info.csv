The same goes for inner seeing and feeling. There are people who constantly have an inner dialogue going on in their mind, others that never have it and still others that only occasionally do it. The article mentions some psychologists and linguists who think it is impossible to not have a way of talking to ourselves all the time such as when we see a word it follows that we have an image of that word in our mind. The author of the article disputes these claims and talks about how science doesn't really have a good method of identifying people who use inner speaking or the other experiences."

When people are in a group setting they don't really think for their self. They use the suggestions of the group or go with the majority of the group. Overall, people are not using their minds to think effectively and are just going with the crowd."
