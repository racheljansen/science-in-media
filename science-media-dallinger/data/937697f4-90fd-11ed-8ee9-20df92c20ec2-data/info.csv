To this end, scientists have attempted to predict psychopathy by examining children and rating them on a series of personality tests. These scales included lack of response to punishment, lack of guilt over wrongdoings, and a tendency to try to skirt punishment or avoid being caught in wrongdoing.  Their findings revealed that toddlers who rated high on these scales tended to develop into adolescents with behavioral problems. Most parents will be able to notice warning signs when a child is roughly two years old, and by three years old these external signs should be visible to others in the child's life, such as caregivers (i.e. babysitters, family friends) and others who the child interacts with regularly, but not on a daily basis. However, the findings have also shown that raising a child in the proper environment, with positive stimuli and positive input, can lead to a change in this predilection, resulting in a change to the child's overall behavior and attitude."

You can take two identical babies and place them in two very different situations, and the end result would be two very different individuals. Our attitudes, our likes, our dislikes, the things we enjoy, all are a product of the environment in which we are raised."
