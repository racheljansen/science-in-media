		<p>Thank you for your participation in our study!</p>

		<p>During this study, we are looking to understand how people think about
		and talk about scientific findings. We are interested to see how people
		understand science (and especially the science of human behavior) and then
		share their understanding with others. In other words, we want to see how
		people who read a news article about science will summarize what they read
		to another person, and how the person who reads the summary will then explain
		it to another person, and so on.</p>

		<p>The summary that you wrote may be shown to other participants, but they
			will not be shown your answers to the questionnaire that you
			took after writing the summary.</p>

    <p>As we explained in the consent form, as part of increasing efforts towards
			transparency and open science in psychology, <b>de-identified</b> data from
			participants in this study will be shared on a data-sharing service after
			the study is completed. The sharing of de-identified and non-sensitive data
			from experiments is becoming a standard in this research area as a way of
			increasing confidence in scientific findings. Again, this means that any data
		 shared on this service will not be connected in any way to your name or MTurk worker ID.</p>

		<p>If you have any questions about this research or would like to have your
			data withheld from the study, you may contact lead researcher Rachel
			Jansen at <a href = "mailto:racheljansen@berkeley.edu" target="_blank">racheljansen@berkeley.edu</a>.</p>
