		<p>Thank you for your participation in our study!</p>

		<p>During this study, we are looking to understand how people think about
		and talk about scientific findings. We are interested to see how people
		understand science (and especially the science of human behavior) and then
		share their understanding with others. In other words, we want to see how
		people who read a news article about science will summarize what they read
		to another person, and how the person who reads the summary will then explain
		it to another person, and so on.</p>

		<p>The summary that you wrote may be shown to another participant, but other
			participants will not be shown your answers to the questionnaire that you
			took after writing the summary.</p>

		<p>If you have any questions about this research or would like to have your
			data withheld from the study, you may contact lead researcher Rachel
			Jansen at <a href = "mailto:racheljansen@berkeley.edu" target="_blank">racheljansen@berkeley.edu</a>.</p>
