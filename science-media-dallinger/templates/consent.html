                <p>This research is being conducted by Rachel Jansen (a graduate student and lead researcher), Alexandra Paxton (a postdoctoral scholar), Peter Krafft (a postdoctoral scholar), and Professor Tom Griffiths (a faculty member) at the University of California, Berkeley. This study will take approximately 10 minutes to complete.</p>

                <p>If you agree to take part in the research, you will complete a study that involves reading some text and then answering some questions. All of the information we obtain during the research <b>will not be associated with your name in any way</b>. However, while the study is running it will be associated with your MTurk worker ID. Once the study is complete, we will replace your worker ID with a random identifier (a series of random letters and numbers).</p>

                <p>As part of increasing efforts towards transparency and open science in psychology, <b>de-identified</b> data from participants in this study will be shared on a data-sharing service after the study is completed. The sharing of de-identified and non-sensitive data from experiments is becoming a standard in this research area as a way of increasing confidence in scientific findings.</p>

                <p>Your participation in this research is voluntary. You are free to refuse to take part, and you may stop taking part at any time. You are free to discontinue participation in this study at any time with no penalty.</p>
